What is the difference beween whale and wallet alert thing?

Whale Alerts: These monitor large transactions that exceed your set threshold. For example, if you set a threshold of $10,000, you'll be notified of any transactions larger than that amount.

Wallet Alerts: These monitor specific wallets that you're tracking (up to 5 wallets). You'll be notified of any transactions involving these wallets, regardless of the transaction amount.

The user can enable:
Just whale alerts (for large transactions)
Just wallet alerts (for tracked wallets)
Both types of alerts using all
For example:
/enablealerts whale - Only get notifications for large transactions above your threshold
/enablealerts wallet - Only get notifications for your tracked wallets
/enablealerts all - Get both types of notifications
The updated help text should make this distinction clearer to users. Would you like me to make any other clarifications to the documentation or code?
